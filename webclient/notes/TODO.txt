Plan:
switch teams to not require a teamId AND teamName (drop the need for name)
Check if on team when requesting badges by team (just returns 0 badges right now if not on team)
Send Team based notifications
set up api test page
rough layout index page
---------------------------------------

Upcoming Plan:
When user unsubscribes, remove endpoint
On Notification send, check if endpoint is still valid (remove if not)
User Preferences (get team notifications?)
Validate against google login status
Clean up API responses
Set up Test User Bots
Test APIs against odd characters
---------------------------------------

Known Bugs
---------------------------------------

Before Release:
upgrade logging to log to files / better control
----------------------------------------

Possibilities:
Send an id with page serve to use as a "key" for the api This will help prevent people from using the api when not from the page(probably not needed as we have cookies)
-----------------------------------------

DONE:
retry promises during creation that end up with non-unique ids
Generate user ids, don't use google id
Save common user details in cookie / don't query DB every time!
