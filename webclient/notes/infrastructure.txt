This seems like a good setup:
https://aghassi.github.io/NodeJS-Express-NginX-Setup/

Run each service in docker containers:
nginx -> node/express -> neo4j

Maybe split push message handling to a separate node container
Initial release, maybe keep api/web/push all handled by the same server.
Be sure to set up the modules to be easy to split out later for the api/web/push handling
